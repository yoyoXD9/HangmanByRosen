Hangman project

This is a project made by Kris, Yoan, Mitko, Rosen and Viki.

Project goals:This project is about creating a fun Hangman Game in C#. Players guess letters to find a hidden word before they run out of attempts.


Solution:
Random Word Selection

The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words using a random generator. This ensures that the word is different for each game, making it unpredictable and challenging for the player.
